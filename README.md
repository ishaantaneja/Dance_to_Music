# BodyBeats 🎶🤖
Turn your body movements into live music using pose tracking + MIDI.

## 🔥 Overview
BodyBeats uses **MediaPipe** for pose estimation and maps your joint movements
into musical notes or beats. Move your hands, legs, or head — and hear sound 
generated in real-time.

## ✨ Inspiration
I am a dancer and wanted to make music using my dance movements.  
The goal is to let the body itself become an instrument — where rhythm, flow, and motion create live soundscapes.
